## Introduction

Welcome to My Recipes, my third milestone project. 

My Recipes is a site that allows users to manage and share a diverse collection of recipes. Through user authentication, visitors can sign up and log in to unlock the full potential of the platform. The core focus of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of Python, the Flask framework, and the utilization of MongoDB as the backend database.

I document the steps I took to plan and create this website as well as where I got my inspiration from and sources of information.

## UX - User Experience Design

To help with design, I opted for a palette of healthy, natural colors, specifically selecting shades of green.

The planning of the project is broken into 5 planes,

 - [The Strategy Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#strategy-plane)
 - [The Scope Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#scope-plane)
 - [The Structure Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#structure-plane)
 - [The Skeleton Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#skeleton-plane)
 - [The Surface Plane](https://github.com/imransal/Runescape-Quiz/blob/main/README.md#surface-plane)

## Strategy Plane

The strategy plan involves conducting thorough research to understand the project's purpose and gather insights into users' preferences and expectations.

User Stories and Creator Goals:

First-time User Goals:
- As a first-time user, I expect to find relevant content related to the project's topic.
- Easy navigation is crucial for a seamless first-time user experience.

Returning User Goals:
- As a returning user, I desire the ability to sign up and create a personalized account on the website.
- Viewing, editing, and deleting my saved recipes are essential features for a returning user.
- The website should facilitate a convenient search function for recipes, catering to the needs of returning users.

### Creator Goals

As a creator, I aim to provide a dedicated platform for users to share their passion and love for cooking and recipes.

- I want people who enjoy cooking to have an easy place to store their recipes.
- I want the platform to be easy to use and navigate.
- I want users to be able to login and view the recipes they have created and be able to modify or delete them.


## Scope Plane

With a clear project idea and goal in mind, I outlined the website's functionalities. The project will include essential CRUD functions, enabling users to interact with the platform and personalize their experience. Users will have the ability to create profiles, which will be utilized to greet them by their chosen usernames and facilitate recipe uploads and consultations.
 
## Structure Plane

I designed a coherent structure for the website. For guest users, the 'Home,' 'Home,' 'Login,' and 'Register' pages will be accessible. Once registered, users can navigate to their personalized 'Profile' page and access 'New Recipe' and 'Manage Cuisines' pages, granting them the option to upload recipes through the 'Add Recipe' page.


## Skeleton Plane

Creating a user-friendly navigation system, I envisioned a landing page with clear calls-to-action, leading users to explore the website's mission clearly displaying All Recipes instantly. After logging in, users will access their 'Profile', 'New Recipe' and if your are an Admin you will see 'Manage Cuisines' pages. To simplify recipe uploads, a straightforward form with a 'plus' icon will be provided to add ingredients and preparation steps.

## Surface Plane 

The stylistic choices for the website revolve around healthy colors, predominantly shades of green. I aim to create an ambiance of simplicity and health throughout the platform, ensuring users feel at ease while exploring the diverse range of recipes.

### Navigation

Upon clicking on the navigation elements, the site is designed to seamlessly direct the user to their respective sections:

Ensuring accurate linkage for each navigation item:
- Home: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- Recipes: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- Recipe: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- Login: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- Register: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- New Recipe: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- Edit Recipe: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- Manage Cuisine: Successfully navigated to the intended section.
- Logout: Sucessfully logs user out of session and navigated to the intended section.

I used Responsive Device Tools to ensure the website is responsive.

### CRUD Testing

To test database functionality for the project, the following steps were taken:

- Create a new User account.
- Verify the presence of the new user in the user collection of MongoDB.
- Create a recipe.
- Confirm the accurate appearance of the recipe in the recipe collection of MongoDB.
- Edit the recipe.
- Ensure the edited recipe is correctly reflected in the recipe collection of MongoDB.
- Delete the recipe.
- Verify the successful removal of the recipe from the recipe collection in MongoDB.
- All tests for CRUD functionality passed successfully.

## Accessibility Test With Lighthouse

Performance can be improved by using next gen images or compressing them.

## Deployment

The main  branch of this repository represents the latest version and has been used to deploy the website.

The Code Institute template was used to create this project. 

[Code Institute Full Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template)

- Click the *Use This Template* button.
- Give your repository a name, and description if you wish.
- Click the *Create Repository from Template* to create your repository. 
- Click the *Gitpod* button to create a gitpod workspace, this can take a few minutes.
- When working on project using Gitpod, please open the workspace from Gitpod, this will open your previous workspace rather than creating a new one.
Use the following commands to commit your work, 
- `git add . ` - adds all modified files to a staging area.
- `git commit -m "A short message exlaining your commit"` - commits all changes to a local repository.
- `git push` - pushes all your commited changes to your Github repository.

**Creating an Application with Heroku,**

- Go to [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) and create an account or login. 
- Click the *New* dropdown and select *Create New App*.
- Enter a name for the project.
- Select your region.

**Connecting your Heroku account to your Github Repository,**

- Click on *Deploy* tab and choose `Github-Connect to Github`.

**PLEASE NOTE TO SUCCESFULLY DEPLOY WITH HEROKU, YOUR PROJECT MUST HAVE A *requirements.txt*  and *Procfile* files.**

The following commands in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files.

`pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

`echo web: python app.py > Procfile`

**Running this Project Locally**

**You will need create a env.py file, which contains all the enviroment variables you used on Heroku, Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being commited.** 

THESE DETAILS SHOULD BE PRIVATE AND SHOULD NOT BE DISCLOSED FOR SECURITY PURPOSES!

- Navigate to the Github repository. 
- Click the *Code*.
- If you choose to download the zip file, you can unpackage this in Gitpod.
- If you choose to copy the Git URL, please continue to follow the steps below.
- In Gitpod, in the CLI type `git clone "Git URL"`.
- This will now create a clone of the project on your machine. 

Once the project has been loaded please run the following command in the CLI to install the project required packages, 

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Creating a Fork of the Project in your Github Repositories**
